### What is it?
I wanted to see if I could make a mod. I like GregTech so this is my for fun implementation following those principles.

### Will you ever finish it?
Probably not since I'm super bad at finishing projects and have a ton of unfinished projects

### What's the point?
I'm having fun and figured I might as well have some kind of Versioning Control on it. Plus the green squares on GitHub give me dopamine
